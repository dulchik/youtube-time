# Oke Youtube Time counter

This is a script that counts how much time you would need to finish watching a specified playlist

The playlist should be "public" or "unlisted" (private playlists would require oauth, which is a pain in the ahh)

All you need is a Youtube Data v3 API key that you can create on [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

Create a .env file and create a variable named API_KEY.
Your .env file should look like this:
```
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

You're all set and done
Now run the script with ```python3 main.py```
